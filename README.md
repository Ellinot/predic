# NBA-predictor
A feedforward neural network for predicting the outcomes of NBA games given current season averages of box scores for each team. The network is implemented using keras with tensorflow as the backend with gpu-support. For an introduction to neural networks, see chapter 3 of [Neural Networks](http://www.dkriesel.com/_media/science/neuronalenetze-en-zeta2-2col-dkrieselcom.pdf).

# Installation guide
If you want to run the classifier you will need to install CUDA, cudnn and tensorflow. This can be quite a hassle on windows, so follow [this guide](https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/hpc/The-Best-Way-to-Install-TensorFlow-with-GPU-Support-on-Windows-10-Without-Installing-CUDA-1187/).
